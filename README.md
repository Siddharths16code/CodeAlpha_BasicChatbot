# 🤖 CodeAlpha Basic Chatbot (Task 3)

A simple **rule-based chatbot** built in Python as part of **CodeAlpha Internship Task 4**.  
The chatbot responds to specific user inputs with predefined replies using conditional logic.

---

## 🎯 Goal

Build a rule-based chatbot that interacts with the user using simple, hardcoded responses.

---

## 📋 Scope (As per Task Instructions)

- ✅ User inputs like: `"hello"`, `"how are you"`, `"bye"`, etc.
- ✅ Predefined replies like: `"Hi!"`, `"I'm fine, thanks!"`, `"Goodbye!"`.
- ✅ Simple `if-elif-else` logic for matching.
- ✅ Loop keeps running until user types `"bye"`.

---

## 🛠️ Key Concepts Used

- `if-elif-else`  
- `functions`  
- `loops`  
- `input/output`  

---

## 🧠 Features

- Case-insensitive input handling (e.g., `Hello`, `HELLO`, or `hello` all work).
- Gracefully exits on `"bye"` or `"exit"`.
- Handles unknown inputs with a polite default response.
- Modular function-based code structure.
